# Text-Editor---PWA

## Description

Progressive Web Applications - or PWA's - behave like native applications. They are designed to improve performance, accessibility, and user experience. 

This text editor will be an example of a PWA, and will be able to be installed and used while offline!

## User Story 
AS A developer
I WANT to create notes or code snippets with or without an internet connection
SO THAT I can reliably retrieve them for later use
